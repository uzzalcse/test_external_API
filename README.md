# Testing External API Without Making Real Calls

This repository demonstrates how to test applications that use external APIs without making actual API calls. This approach is useful for:

- Unit testing
- Offline development
- Faster test execution

## Features

- Mock API responses
- Test scenarios without external dependencies
- Example implementations of API mocking

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (if any)
3. Run the tests

## Usage

The examples show how to:
- Mock HTTP requests
- Simulate API responses
- Handle different test scenarios

## Best Practices

- Keep mock data realistic
- Test both success and error cases
- Maintain mock data separately
